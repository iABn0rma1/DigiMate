Their favorite foods include grasses, leaves, fruits, and bark. They can eat up to 300 pounds of food every day!\n\nIndian elephants live in herds led by a wise old female called a matriarch. They are very social animals and spend a lot of time interacting with each other. They communicate using a variety of sounds, including trumpets, rumbles, and squeals.\n\nSadly, Indian elephants are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.

There, in the middle of a clearing, was a beautiful rainbow that stretched all the way across the sky. Ela had never seen anything so beautiful before, and she was filled with wonder.\n\nEla decided to follow the rainbow, and as she walked, she met all sorts of interesting animals. She met a wise old owl, a mischievous monkey, and a friendly tiger. Each animal told Ela a different story about the rainbow, and Ela listened with rapt attention.\n\nFinally, Ela reached the end of the rainbow, and there she found a pot of gold! But Ela was not interested in the gold. She had learned so much on her adventure, and she had made so many new friends. She decided to leave the gold behind and return to her home in the jungle.\n\nWhen Ela returned home, she told her friends all about her adventure. They were amazed by her stories, and they all agreed that Ela was a very special elephant.\n\nAnd so, Ela continued to live in the jungle, and she continued to have many more adventures.
